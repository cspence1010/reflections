Lesson 2:


What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
-When we initialize a repository it creates the repository for the first time,
but Git does not create an initial commit, or snapshot, of the history. This
is important to remember as commands such as 'git status' and 'git log' will
return errors or inform us that there is no history to be viewed, no changes
made. It's important to initialize our own repositories so that we can save
our commits and keep a history of the changes made to our code. This allows us
to create our own repositories rather than 'borrowing' from someone else's
work.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repositroy? What value do you think it offers?
-The staging area is an intermediary area, it is between the working directory 
and the repository. Before you make a commit, and make any changes, you can add
files to the staging area. They wont appear yet in the repository until the
commit has been made. It allows us to view the changes before we make any
commit. While Git allows us to review and go back and undo any changes, the
staging area gives us the opportunity to review our changes before they are
added to the repository.
