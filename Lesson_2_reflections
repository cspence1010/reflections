Lesson 2:

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
-When we initialize a repository it creates the repository for the first time,
but Git does not create an initial commit, or snapshot, of the history. This
is important to remember as commands such as 'git status' and 'git log' will
return errors or inform us that there is no history to be viewed, no changes
made. It's important to initialize our own repositories so that we can save
our commits and keep a history of the changes made to our code. This allows us
to create our own repositories rather than 'borrowing' from someone else's
work.
