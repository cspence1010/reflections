Lesson 3:


When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-You would want to use a remote repository in the scenario when you're working with multiple people on the same
file or project. So for example, if I were to work on a game with someone else, we would want a remote repository
where both of our work was being saved and could be accessed easily.
-If I were to work on the same project from multiple devices it would also be useful to have my work saved on a
remote repository so I could update my work and continue where I left off without having to transfer to each device
after every change.
